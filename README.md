# ScanBarcodesDemo

ScanBarcodesDemo scans barcodes using an iPhone or iPad camera and displays their textual content. This demo project is a wrapper for the [ScanBarcodes](https://github.com/nasa-jpl/ScanBarcodes) Swift package for iOS.

  The barcode scanner uses [AVFoundation](https://developer.apple.com/av-foundation/) for high performance video capture and barcode recognition. There are also controls for the flashlight and the zoom level of the camera.

## Getting started

Build and run this project with an attached iPhone or iPad device using the latest version of XCode. The iOS simulator is not supported yet until camera supoprt is added to it.
